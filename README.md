# Code Challenge

We're going to make a lottery game! Where the user can define a set of numbers, and play a virtual lottery.

In our lottery, we're going to use the numbers 1 through 19, and the user only needs to select 3 numbers to win.

I've setup a `lotto.js` file to get us started. You should be able to copy and paste the file into your browsers console to see it working.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Pick your winning numbers

In the lotto class, select 3 numbers which are your winning numbers.

### Task 2: Let users input their chosen numbers

We want users to pick their numbers like:

    lotto.setChosenNumbers([3,5,6]);

### Task 3: When the users chosen numbers match the ones picked, tell them they're a winner

The final step! Make it so when the users chosen numbers match our winning numbers, we tell them about it.
